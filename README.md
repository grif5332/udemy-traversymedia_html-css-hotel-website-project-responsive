# udemy-traversymedia_html-css-hotel-website-project-responsive

Essentially this is the first version of the site from the course...but some added bits to make it responsive.

The first thing done was to add a second css file for mobile devices. Rather than add it to the style css file with @media, We added the mobile css file to a <link> in the html.  This seperates the mobile css from the main site css for, what seems like easier editing.  We changed the menu a bit, adjusted a fee elements.

The final outcome looks pretty good on most current devices.
